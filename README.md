# ParticlesSimulationProject

A collision detection simulation project based on the model highlighted in this post: https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/61event/

## Run Instructions

Navigate to src folder and in terminal run `javac Main.java`
To generate random particles, supply integer value (with good consideration for your machine's computational power) in command line
For eg. `java Main 10` will start application with 10 randomly placed particles.

To place data yourself, leave command line argument empty and paste data on prompt.
Sample data available in `sample inputs` folder for a variety of scenarios.
